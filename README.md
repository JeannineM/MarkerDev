# Marker development from RNAseq data

We developed a workflow to extract shared orthologous regions between sister taxa from RNAseq data. Steps include:
- transcriptome de novo assembly
- redundancy removal and extracting longest open reading frame transcripts
- variant discovery
- variant calling and filtering for fixed differences
- design of amplicon regions

See https://github.com/JeannineM/MarkerDev/blob/master/SupportingScriptNotesGitHub.Rmd for examplified code.
